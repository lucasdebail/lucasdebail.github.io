I'm a former Air Traffic Controller and OJTI (On-the-Job Training Instructor) in the Brazilian Air Force, with nearly nine years at Curitiba Approach Control, the country's 6th busiest Terminal Area. I've also worked as an Aviation English Instructor and an EPLIS rater for Air Traffic Controllers (the Brazilian English proficiency exam for Air Traffic Controllers).

I hold a degree in English Language (Letras Inglês) from the Federal Technological University of Paraná (UTFPR), where I studied various aspects of Linguistics. During my senior year, I researched Speech Intelligibility during Runway Incursions.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Arts in Applied Linguistics at Georgia State University (GSU) in Atlanta, with a focus on Aviation English and LHUFT (Language as a Human Factor in Aviation).

My primary research interests include Natural Language Processing, human-to-human interaction, and human-machine interaction in aviation. 

Outside of academia, I am really interested in photography, biking and Música Popular Brasileira (MPB). <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/246Qt0JgcQpwUBocdqB1Eosi=ullxsmFwSSa0VJU83l3vGg&pt=02a5e0cf40ee4ee30b804ea514da91b0">Here is a Spotify playlist with some of my favorite artists.</a>
